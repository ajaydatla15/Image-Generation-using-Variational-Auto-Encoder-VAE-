# Image-Generation-using-Variational-Auto-Encoder-VAE-
Built and trained a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on the CelebA dataset to generate realistic celebrity faces. Used a CNN-based encoder-decoder, KL divergence, and reconstruction loss to learn facial representations. Explored latent space interpolation for smooth feature transitions.
